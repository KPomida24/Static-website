            <h2>About Us</h2>
            <p> A small Business started by my family Long ago, Back in 1970, Back then it was named Shapers.
                We were the first Tailoring business in the whole of the Eastern Samar,
                and paradoxically one of the last remaining Tailoring shops in the Island as more and more clothing
                is Outsourced to China. The name Shapers was due to my Grand parents ability to tailor-make
                clothing that fit the shape and form of our customers. Today Shapers is suceeded by Pomidas Tailoring & prints.
                Our goal is to provide clothing the modern world without outsourcing to another country.</p>
